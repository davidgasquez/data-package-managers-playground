# ðŸ“¦ Data Package Managers Playground

Play and experiment with different Data Package Managers. Check out some common "Git for Data" tools and see how they work.

## :rocket: Getting Started

You can easily get started with GitHub CodespacesÂ¹ or Visual Studio Code Development Containers. Alternatively, you can also run the playground with Docker (`make dev`).

You can now start running computation over data using Bacalhau, Kamu, Iroh and other tools!

Â¹ Click on the green "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
